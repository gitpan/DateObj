Date::Object README
-------------------

This package tries to provide an OO interface to date and time
variables.  More importantly, it provides a way to deal with 
dates as mathematical quantities in a form that is more natural
and perhaps more accurate (in some ways).

The main goal of this package was to provide a way to treat
dates as numbers, and to do so accurately without much hassle.
Which means you can increment dates with ++ and set the day to
day + 10 and not worry about having to wrap the day for the 
month, etc.

Currently this package uses the perl ctime wrappers, so it suffers
from the limitations of that package.  Additionally, it currently
uses local time, so working with timezones might not work to as
expected (although I hope to change that in the future).

If you run into any problems, please just drop me an email.


Thanks for trying it,
